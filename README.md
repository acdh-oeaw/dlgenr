# genR – web application

This git repository contains the code for web application of the project „A Dictionary of Loanwords in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah“ (FWF project number P 30785).

Please note that the **dictionary data** itself are not part of this repository since they are curated with the [Viennese Lexicographic Editor (VLE)](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/tools/vle/) and reside inside a dedicated instance of the [BaseX XML database](http://basex.org/).
